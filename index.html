Hello my name is Rafael Estrella, I am a 26 year old Queens native with a passion for food, travel and exploration. In my leisure time I induldge in my creativity. My interests include art, yoga and meditation. Your body must be strong but your mind even stronger. I am studying to become a Full-Stack Developer, my goal is to become an expert. I want to be able to help kickstart companies get the recognition they deserve as well as be an asset to an already well established company. I am a very determined and focused individual with a very hard work ethic. I am currently learning to master HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT. I am studying extensively to learn the rest of the languages so I can be a well rounded individual with skills and talent to help elevate any company.
